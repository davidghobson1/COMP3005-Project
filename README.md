# COMP3005-Project
Web-based application for the LookInnaBook online bookstore

This app is based on Node.js and Express.

To use the app, make sure you have all files including the package.json file in the same directory. Navigate to the directory in the command line and run "npm install". This should automatically download all the dependencies you need to run the app.

After that, run "node server.js" in the command line, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your favourite browser, and enjoy browsing and buying books!
